You may think this may be a small kiosk cafe right across Victory Ortigas at the 4th floor of Robinsons Galleria, but IL PADRINO is definitely a must-try for all coffee and Italian cuisine lovers here in Metro Manila! Upon entering, you would be amazed at the different designs of their tables and chairs to the point that it would be hard to pick which oneâ€™s the best one to sit! But all the more, when you order, you would feel at home with the very friendly and courteous waiters and staff at this cafe. And here's a bonus point for bookworms: there is a book shelf filled with books for you to read while your order is being whipped up!
