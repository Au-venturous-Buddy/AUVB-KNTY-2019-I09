<h3>Iced Coffee</h3>
Lastly, there is the Iced Coffee of IL PADRINO, which is creamy coffee served ice-blended (much like Starbucks' Frappuccinos). It tastes very mild and sweet, resembling more to a mocha shake than a typical ice-blended coffee.

<h2>Conclusion</h2>
IL PADRINO is definitely a great place to hang out if you're a fan of coffee and Italian food! You'll love the different designs of their tables and chairs, and the waiters and staff are very friendly and kind! Above all, their food is very delicious, and their pasta dishes are cooked al dente, not too hard and not too soft. The best part is that their dishes are very affordable and their servings are generous! In fact, one of the guests said that her Aglio Olio was served in large portions that she thought she couldnâ€™t finish it in one sitting, yet she ended up finishing it mainly because the pasta was cooked perfectly. ðŸ™‚
