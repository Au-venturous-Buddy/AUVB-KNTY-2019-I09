<h3>Braised Pork</h3>
Last on the list is their Braised Pork, which is as simple as pork simmered in vinegar and spices. In other words, it is the Hawaiian version of the authentic Filipino Adobo and Paksiw na Lechon (FYI an authentic Filipino Adobo DO NOT contain any soy sauce at all!). It has the perfect balance of sweet, sour, and kick, and the meat is very tender.

Both the Pastele Stew and the Braised Pork were offered by the head chef for us to sample what's he's been cooking in the kitchen. What a treat to us! We're treated like VIPs!

<h2>Conclusion</h2>
Haili's is truly imbibed in the Hawaiian food scene, and serves the best authentic native Hawaiian food I have ever tasted throughout my stay in Hawaii. Their Combination Hawaiian Plate Lunch is the best of everything Hawaiian cuisine has to offer, and their Pastele Stew and Braised Pork remind me a lot of my usual Filipino food fare. So if you're planning on food tripping in Honolulu, make Haili's Hawaiian Foods a top priority in your list!
