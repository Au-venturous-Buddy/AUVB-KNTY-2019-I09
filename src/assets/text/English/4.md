<h3>Baked Ziti</h3>
The Baked Ziti at IL PADRINO is served hot, and it is actually penne cooked in sweet tomato sauce and ground beef, and then covered in mozzarella cheese (which is the best part of this dish) and baked. Hence, their Baked Ziti tastes sweet, meaty, and most importantly, gooey (all because of that melted mozzarella cheese goodness)! Like the Aglio Olio, it comes with two pieces of herb focaccia which you then dip in a saucer filled with olive oil and balsamic vinegar.
