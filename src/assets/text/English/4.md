<h3>Combination Hawaiian Plate Lunch</h3>
One of Haili's most popular dishes is the Combination Hawaiian Plate Lunch, which is an assortment of some of the most well-known of the local dishes of Hawaii, including Kalua Pig (which is similar to the Filipino Lechon but with a slightly more sour aftertaste because of the vinegar), Laulau (which is pork or chicken mixed with fish and wrapped in taro leaves), Poke (which is a salad made with raw fish, much like the Filipino Kilawin na Isda), and Lomi Salmon (which is like Poke except that it's made with salmon). It comes served with your choice of either white rice or Poi (which is actually a pudding made out of yam and with a slightly sour taste, and trust me, their Poi is the best I've ever tasted in my stay in Hawaii), and this also comes with a popular Hawaiian dessert known as Haupia (which is a coconut pudding similar to another Filipino dish, which is Maja Blanca). And my verdict? Of all the restaurants I have eaten at Hawaii, none have perfected authentic native Hawaiian food than Haili's. The dishes have the perfect balance of sweet, sour, and smokiness, and their serving size is very generous!
