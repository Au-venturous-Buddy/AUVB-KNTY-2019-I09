<h3>Aglio Olio</h3>
The Aglio Olio at IL PADRINO is not your ordinary Aglio Olio. Traditional Aglio Olio is usually just pasta cooked with olive oil, garlic, chili flakes, anchovies, and a hint of lemon juice, but IL PADRINO takes it to the next level by adding sundried tomatoes and grilled vegetables (such as red bell peppers and onions), giving the pasta a tangy and smoky profile. What's more, it's healthy! It is served with two pieces of herb focaccia, which you dip in a saucer filled with olive oil and balsamic vinegar (trust me, it's a match made in heaven!).
