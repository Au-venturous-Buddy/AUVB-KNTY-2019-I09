<h2>Bonus Feature</h2>
It so happened that, when we tried to go to Haili's, they were closed to prepare food for a certain event. However, as we were about to leave, the owner, Ms. Lorraine Haili herself, told us that they're willing to open their doors just for us because they have freshly cooked food to serve. And yes, their food is indeed delicious! Thanks Ms. Lorraine Haili, and even the head chef (who happens to have a Filipino blood), for a job well done and for extending your hospitality to us.
