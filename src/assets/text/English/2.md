Located in the suburban outskirts of Honolulu, Hawaii, Haili's Hawaiian Foods has proven itself to be a local cuisine institution throughout its history. The restaurant interiors invoke the feeling of eating at a typical polynesian home with its tropical yellow-green interiors, photos, and decorations. And the counter actually resembles those that you would usually encounter in a typical Filipino Carinderia.
