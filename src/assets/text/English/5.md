<h3>Pastele Stew</h3>
Next is Haili's Pastele Stew, which is meat and vegetables (such as potatoes, olives, etc.) simmered in tomato sauce and spices. The taste of it is actually a cross among the following Filipino dishes: Caldereta, Mechado, and Callos, or even a better description, an elevated version of those dishes. It is very saucy, and one can taste the the intermingling of the different spices that make it.
