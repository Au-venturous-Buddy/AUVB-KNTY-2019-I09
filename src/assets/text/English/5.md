<h3>Neapolitana Pizza</h3>
IL PADRINO's Neapolitana Pizza may look like a Margherita Pizza, but it's more than that! It has a crust that is chewy on the inside, crispy on the outside, and bursting with notes of herbs. It is topped with tomato sauce, whole basil leaves, juicy tomato slices, and gooey mozzarella cheese. It's definitely worth something to try at this cafe!
